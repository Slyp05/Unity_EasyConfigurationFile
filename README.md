# Unity_EasyConfigurationFile
A simple script that you can edit to have a configuration asset in your Unity plugin!

The configuration asset file will be created automatically.
The script will also add a top bar menu where the user will be able to access the configuration easily.

The user moving the plugin folder isn't an issue (the script detects the folder it is in automatically).
